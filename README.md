# WTFS

## Business Use Case
We need an alternative to TFS made in house so that our devs cannot complain about how bad it is compared to `x` because we let them make it. The MVP includes creating issues and sprints.

## A Few Business rules
Users should belong to teams
Every issue created should have a reference to who created it and when.
Every sprint should be tied to a team.
Sprints can only be created if the team doesn't currently have an active sprint.
