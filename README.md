# WTFS

## Business Use Case
We need an in house solution to replace TFS. This will stop the complaining about how bad it is compared to other products.
The MVP includes being able to create users, issues, teams and sprints.

## A Few Business rules
Users should belong to teams
Every issue created should have a reference to who created it and when.
Every sprint should be tied to a team.
Sprints can only be created if the team doesn't currently have an active sprint.

## Features to implement next
Being able to add issues to sprints
Marking Issues as resolved
Closing sprints
