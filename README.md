# WTFS

## Business Use Case

We need an in house solution for managing a backlog of features/issues which would allow teams to plan sprints around the backlog.
The MVP includes being able to create users, issues, teams and sprints.

## A Few Business rules

Users should belong to a team
Every issue created should have a reference to who created it and when.
Every sprint should be tied to a team.
Sprints can only be created if the team doesn't currently have an active sprint.

## Features to implement next

Being able to add issues to sprints
Marking Issues as resolved
Closing sprints
