# Sprint Planner

## Business Use Case

We need an in house solution for managing a backlog of features/issues which would allow teams to plan sprints around the backlog.
The MVP includes being able to create users, issues, teams and sprints.

## Structure

- Users belong to teams
- Issues belong to users.
- Sprints belong to teams.

## Business Rule

- Sprints can only be created if the team doesn't currently have an active sprint.
